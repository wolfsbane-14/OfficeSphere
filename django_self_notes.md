- project is the ENTIRE DJANGO APPLICATION
- app is a module inside the project that deals with one specific case

- for eg -- payment system (app) in eCommerce app (project)

- a project, on the other hand, is a collection of these apps

- therefore, a single project can consist of 'n' number of apps and a single app can be in multiple projects

### Explain How A Request Is Processed In Django?

- Here, a user requests for a resource to the Django, Django works as a controller and checks to the available resource in URL.
- When Django server is started, the `manage.py` file searches for `settings.py` file, which contains information of all the applications installed in the project, middleware used, database connections and path to the main URLs config.

`Manage.py >> Setting.py >> urls.py >> views.py >> models.py >> templates`

![Django Request Process](./image.png)

- Django first determines which root URLconf or URL configuration module is to be used.
- Then, that particular Python module `urls` is loaded and then Django looks for the variable `urlpatterns`.
- Then check each URL pattern in `urls.py` file, and it stops at the first match of the requested URL.
- Once that is done, the Django then imports and calls the given view.
- In case none of the URLs match the requested URL, Django invokes an error-handling view.
- If URL maps, a view is called that interacts with the model and template, it renders a template.
- Django responds back to the user and sends a template as a response.


## How To View All Items In The Model Using Django QuerySet?

**Django Command To View All Items In A Model:**

## What Is Context In Django?

- A context in Django is a dictionary, in which keys represent variable names and values represent their values. This dictionary (context) is passed to the template which then uses the variables to output the dynamic content.

- A context is a variable name -> variable value mapping that is passed to a template.

- Context processors let you specify a number of variables that get set in each context automatically â€“ without you having to specify the variables in each `render()` call.


## How to Delete/Insert/Update An Object Using QuerySet In Django?

### QuerySet To Insert/Add An Object:

## Explain Q Objects in Django ORM?

**Q object** `django.db.models.Q` is an object to encapsulate a collection of keyword arguments specified as FIELD LOOKUPS.  
**Q objects** are used to write complex queries, as in filter() functions just "AND" the conditions, while if you want to "OR" the conditions you can use Q objects.

Let's see an example:

```python
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Q

Models.objects.get( 
  Q(question__startswith='When') | 
  Q(answer__startswith='On') | 
  Q(answer__startswith='At') 
)
```

[Q Objects can be combined with the help of the | and & operators to get a new Q Object]

This is equivalent to the following SQL WHERE Clause:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Model WHERE question LIKE 'When%' 
  AND (answer='On%' OR answer='At%')
```
